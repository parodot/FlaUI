# How to contribute
Thank you for your interest in improving FlaUI.

## Getting Started
FlaUI uses the latest version of Visual Studio to build. As build system, cake build is used. To make a full build, the best is to run the cake `Package` task.

## Contributions
Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests.
Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor and either be merged in the
main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.

## Pull Request Checklist
- Branch from the master branch and keep your branch updated (by rebasing NOT merging).
- Keep your commit history clean and squash them together as needed.
